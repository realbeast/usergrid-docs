Usergrid is a cloud-based data platform that manages objects and aids in the development of mobile client applications. It provides a core set of commonly used social media application objects, including a rich user model, as well as the ability to create new objects and object collections. Usergrid organizes these objects (or “entities”) in a robust, free-form database, making it easy for you to save, search, and retrieve them and connect applications to service endpoints. 


Features include:
                                                         
* An easy-to-use REST API         
* A JSON-optimized user data model with real-time search capabilities        
* A pre-built infrastructure that powers user interactions
* A user interface (the Developer Portal) that lets you manipulate data and is itself an example of how to incorporate Usergrid with Javascript        


**User Model**


Usergrid supplies a sophisticated user framework that allows you to organize users into groups, project teams, departments, or other logical structures. You can build social graphs easily to connect users together. Usergrid streamlines authentication, allowing you to authenticate users via Facebook, Twitter, or other OAuth-enabled services, automatically synchronizing user profiles.


**Collections**


You can store any type of application data formatted with JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) in the Usergrid infrastructure and immediately perform query or fulltext searches on any field. Pre-built entities and entity collections
help you to accelerate the development of content-rich applications. You can share data with other users, and import, export, and sync your application content with third-party applications.


**Messages and Activities**


Usergrid automates user interaction and communications in the form of activity streams, enabling activities such as status updates, check-ins, comments, or other broadcasts to fellow users. You can deliver activities to connected users to support messaging and notifications.


**Data Analytics**


Usergrid allows you to log all data events generated by an application, even in real-time, with the ability to store, search, and analyze at any level of scale. You can perform time-based data analysis at different increments, all the way from by-the-minute to by-the-month. As a result, Usergrid easily powers  computation-intensive features such as up-to-the-minute leaderboards, voting, and live audience reaction. At any moment in time, you can let your users see who's the top-ranking player, or vote for their favorite contestant.
