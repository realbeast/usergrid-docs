Security Model
============== 


This section contains information about the security model in Usergrid. It describes how Usergrid performs authentication and mediates access to resources.


As described in these pages, Usergrid relies on OAuth 2.0 for authentication, basing data access decisions on tokens supplied with each API request. Appropriate credentials are necessary to generate these tokens. Access to Usergrid entities is further restricted by assigned roles and permissions.
