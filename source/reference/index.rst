Usergrid API Reference
======================


This section contains reference information for endpoints and entities in the Usergrid API, as well as a general overview of API operations and how to construct API requests.


Please remember that your actual HTTP REST requests need to have the full URL path that includes “http://api.usergrid.com.” Also, remember to include an access token with all API calls unless the documentation explicitly says that it is not necessary.
