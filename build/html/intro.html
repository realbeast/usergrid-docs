<p>Usergrid is a cloud-based data platform for managing application objects and
data for mobile and rich client applications.</p>
<p>Usergrid provides a core set of application objects for managing users and

collections of any type. Finally, we provide a simple and flexible way to log
data, providing convenient realtime event stream analysis and capturing and
tracking key metrics.</p>
