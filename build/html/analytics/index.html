<p>Most applications today need to provide analytics capabilities for business
intelligence, revenue generation, product improvement, and end-user
functionality. For example, for most apps, you want to be able to know how
often people are launching your application, whether certain features are
popular, and other statistics of user behavior for sponsorship or advertising
purposes. Usergrid provides a very flexible mechanism for keeping track of any
sorts of metrics.</p>
