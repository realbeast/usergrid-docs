<li>We&#8217;re recommending using the <a class="reference external" href="https://usergrid.ci.cloudbees.com/job/Usergrid%20Nightly/lastSuccessfulBuild/org.usergrid$usergrid-launcher/artifact/org.usergrid/usergrid-launcher/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/usergrid-launcher-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar">Usergrid Launcher</a>,
to run your own local Usergrid instance during the Beta period. We&#8217;ll be
slowly letting people into the beta of the live service but running it
locally will let you get started right away. We&#8217;ll also be adding
additional documentation and tools for running your own installation at
Amazon and other hosting providers.</li>
<li>There are a lot of pieces of the Console that are still being worked on.
Not all of these will be in the first open release and will be removed. The
API is still be preferred mechanism for all object management.</li>
